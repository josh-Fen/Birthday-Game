Birthday-Game
=============

Following a tutorial from Pixelnest with some of my own additions

I made this game using Unty following a turoial that was written by Pixelnest, which can be here: http://pixelnest.io/tutorials/2d-game-unity/

I added extra enemies, power-ups, extra particle effects, and a way for the player to get extra health since the difficulty ramps up toward the stage's end.
There is also a boss battle at the stage's end which I also created using Pixelnest and tweaking until the boss's health felt right.
