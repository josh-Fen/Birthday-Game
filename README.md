Birthday-Game
=============

I made this game as a birthday present for my niece using the Unity Game Engine and following a tutorial that was written by Pixelnest, which can be here: http://pixelnest.io/tutorials/2d-game-unity/

I added extra enemies, power-ups, extra particle effects, and a way for the player to get extra health since the difficulty ramps up toward the stage's end.
There is also a boss battle at the end of the stage which I created using another Pixelnest tutorial and my own judgment for the boss's health and behavior.
